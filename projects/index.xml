      <description>One reason I prefer FB Messenger (or any other social messaging app like Whatsapp, Telegram, etc.) over texting someone with the default phone texting app is because in Messenger, when I go to message someone, I see their great face looking back at me in their profile picture!&#xA;If I open my texting app to text or call someone instead, then usually they will just have empty circles because I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to manually add a picture for them.</description>
