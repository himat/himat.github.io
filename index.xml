      <description>Questions I&#39;m still thinking about:
 It is very hard to change a city. But, I believe there are transportation methods we haven&#39;t conceived of yet that will benefit from future restructurings of our cities. So, how can we make physical infrastructure more fluid? How do we build Hogwarts? A place where we can raise people&#39;s ambitions by providing a magical environment in which (young) people can grow and realize how much more they can achieve.</description>

      <description>These are the values, principles, and beliefs of my life that my subconscious mind has repeated so often that my conscious mind could finally notice and codify them.  Creation is everything. I must always be changing the things around me, never preserving them.  I would die for my friends. Love is the most powerful emotion in the world - I will promote love. Stagnation is death. Behavior = f(character, environment).</description>
