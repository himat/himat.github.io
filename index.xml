      <description>Questions I&#39;m still thinking about:
 It is very hard to change a city. But, I believe there are transportation methods we haven&#39;t conceived of yet that will benefit from future restructurings of our cities. So, how can we make physical infrastructure more fluid? What are the decades-long experiments I can do myself that would be useful to humanity? There are definitely a lot of things that would be hard to convince enough people to try over decades, so even just a few people doing them might be useful.</description>

      <title>Life Quests, not Goals</title>

      <description>Some people say they have goals that they want to accomplish in life.
I, however, have goals and quests.
I&#39;ll explain what quests are, but I would recommend reevaluating your goals and considering turning some of them into quests. If you adopt this framing of quests and goals, then you might be able to better approach some of the things you want to do in life.
This quests and goals mindset is something I thought of in the past few years just because it seemed natural for me to think of things in this way.</description>

      <description>These are the values, principles, and beliefs of my life that my subconscious mind has repeated so often that my conscious mind could finally notice and codify them.  Creation is everything. I must always be changing the things around me, never preserving them.  Love is the most powerful emotion in the world - I will promote love. Stagnation is death. Without me actively doing/starting anything, nothing will move forward.</description>
