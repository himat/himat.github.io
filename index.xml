      <description>Questions I&#39;m still thinking about:
 Should developing countries go straight to using renewable energy sources, and leapfrog coal and other non-renewables? How do I balance managing the enormous amount of information I could be consuming around me at any given moment with actually actioning on the information I have already? i.e. How do I re-balance my information-action ratio? It is very hard to change a city. But, I believe there are transportation methods we haven&#39;t conceived of yet that will benefit from restructurings of cities.</description>

      <description>These are the values and principles of my life that my subconscious mind has repeated so often that my conscious mind could finally notice and codify them. Values/Principles
 Creation is everything. I must always be changing and never preserving. I would die for my friends. Love is the most powerful emotion in the world - I will promote love. Stagnation is death. Behavior = f(character, environment). Corollary: Don&#39;t immediately assume the worst in others.</description>
