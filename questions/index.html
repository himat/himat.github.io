      <p>Questions I'm still thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is very hard to change a city. But, I believe there are transportation methods we haven't conceived of yet that will benefit from future restructurings of our cities. So, how can we make physical infrastructure more fluid?</li>
<li>What are the decades-long experiments I can do myself that would be useful to humanity to do? There are definitely a lot of things for which it can be hard to convince enough people to try over decades.</li>
<li>How do we build Hogwarts? A magical environment in which people can grow, collaborate, and achieve things they never thought possible.</li>
<li>Should developing countries go straight to using renewable energy sources, and leapfrog coal and other non-renewables?</li>
<li>How do I balance the enormous amount of information I could be consuming around me at any given moment with actually actioning on that information? (i.e. How do I balance my information-action ratio?)</li>
<li>On what time-span should we be making policy decisions? There are some decisions that are great on the order of centuries, and others on the order of years. But it would be bad to choose either extreme.</li>
<li>Can you incentivize private industry to fund basic research (right now only governments seem to fund this)?</li>
<li>Globalization increases the world average, but doesn't move the min. True or false?</li>
<li>Can we make a general framework for growing a given country, from undeveloped to developed?</li>
</ul>
