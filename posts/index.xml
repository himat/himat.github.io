      <description>Some people say they have goals that they want to accomplish in life.
I, however, have goals and quests.
I&#39;ll explain what quests are, but I would recommend reevaluating your goals and considering turning some of them into quests. If you adopt this framing of quests and goals, then you might be able to better approach some of the things you want to do in life.
This quests and goals mindset is something I thought of in the past few years just because it seemed natural for me to think of things in this way.</description>
