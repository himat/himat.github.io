<li><span title="Unfortunately, most people are under-utilizing themselves, their abilities, and potential. I hope to change that by encouraging more people to create.

<li>I would die for my friends.</li>
<li>Love is the most powerful emotion in the world - I will promote love.</li>
<li>Stagnation is death.</li>
<li>Behavior = f(character, environment). Corollary: Don't immediately assume the worst in others.</li>
<li>Without me actively doing/starting anything, nothing will move forward.</li>
<li>I like people who think. Unfortunately, <em>&ldquo;Many people would rather die than think; in fact, many do.&quot;</em> ~ Bertrand Russell.</li>
<li>I like people, in general. Talking with, noticing, and interacting with all people is one of the best parts of my day and life.</li>
<li>No one is a leader, but everyone has the option to make leadership decisions. Every day, we are given an inordinate number of opportunities to make such decisions.</li>
<li>I usually assume the best in others.</li>
<li>I like playing perfect information games. But, I also like playing imperfect information games, so that I can turn them into perfect ones.</li>
<li>I must always change the environment around me, this is how magic is created.</li>
<li>We only have one life to live and we cannot do everything. This is why I want to hear the experiences of others. We can pseudo-live a million lives, and learn part of what they learned.</li>
<li>First impressions are always wrong. People always impress you more than you would have thought.</li>
<li>Globalization increases the world average, but doesn't move the min.</li>
<li>Most people are too timid to take matters into their own hands.</li>
<li>Someone, such as governments, must fund basic research (otherwise the positive externalities don't manifest).</li>
<li>There's no reason to be sad for an extended amount of time, we must mourn when mourning is due, but for all else, what's done is done.</li>
<li>If you have nothing to lose from trying something, then just do it.</li>
<li>We are able to control our emotions and feelings to a much greater degree than we humans normally think we can.</li>
<li>Every day, I must push this one body I am given.</li>
<li>Seamless. In the ideal form, everything should be seamless. This is my guiding design principle.</li>
<li>If you don't write it down, it doesn't exist.</li>
